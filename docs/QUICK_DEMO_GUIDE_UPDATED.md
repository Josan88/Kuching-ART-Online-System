## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Q: Tests fail with timeout errors when looking for elements**  
A: The working tests in `integrated-demo.test.js` use standard HTML element selectors (IDs, classes) which match the demo HTML. Avoid using the deprecated `getByTestId()` selectors.

**Q: Demo doesn't show all features**  
A: Some UI components may be partially implemented in the demo. The tests gracefully handle these cases with appropriate messaging.

**Q: Where are the test videos?**  
A: Test videos are saved in the `test-results` directory after each run. All tests are now recorded (not just failures).

**Q: How do I see the test report?**  
A: Run `npx playwright show-report` after test execution to see the HTML test report.
